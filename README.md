=======

Package `spice` attempts to implement a SPICE proxy.
It can be used to proxy virt-viewer/remote-viewer traffic to destination qemu instances.

This package is still unfinished. The API is highly unstable.

TODO:
- implement proper capability handling
- implement compute discovery
- implement SASL authentication
